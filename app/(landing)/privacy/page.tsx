            Privacy Policy
            Effective June 6, 2024
            Squire was created to help people get structured documentation from health conversations. Squire
            provides services through the Squire Service (“Squire App”, “App”, “the Squire Services,” “Squire” or
            “the Services”). Our goal with this Privacy Policy is to inform you about how Squire works by
            explaining the data you provide, data we collect, how we use it to provide the Services and
            when it is shared.
            What personal data does Squire collect when used?
            Account Information. We may collect contact information such as your phone number, email,
            address, or single sign-on login information to create an account and allow you to access it.
            Health Information. When you utilize Squire for a doctor/patient conversation, we process the
            audio into a readable note that we store. We use the audio to create a recording summary
            tailored to you or your health professional which may include content from the audio.
            Activity. You can interact with your recordings in several ways in the Services to help you with
            organization. For example, you can add a title, the name of the patient you spoke with, use a
            suggested tag, edit a medical mention to improve accuracy, or highlight a particular moment for
            easy access. We store Your Activity in association with your account.
            Analytics and Passively Collected Data. We collect data about how you use Squire through pixel
            tags and cookies including your IP address, mobile device ID, click or tap history, type of OS or
            browser and other actions on the Services. This information is collected from your phone or web
            browser as you interact with web and mobile apps and helps us improve your experience with
            the Services.
            Feedback and Support. We love to hear from you! Whether you have an idea to make Squire
            better or need a little help, we store the emails you send us and use them to help us prioritize
            how to improve our product.
            De-identified Data. De-identified Data is non-personal information that is aggregated or
            de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We use de-identified
            data for research and development of new products or tools, to refine our algorithms and
            machine learning applications, and to improve the Services and the services we provide. We
            may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about
            health, to partners under agreement with us, or in benchmarking information we provide to the
            medical community.
            How does Squire use personal data?
            We process personal data to provide the Service to you:
            We use machine learning to process your audio and create a note of relevant medical mentions
            that we provide to you.
            We use your name, email address, and mobile phone number to manage your account, contact
            you about your use of Squire, respond to your requests, and inform you of new features or
            products.
            We use Analytics and Passively Collected Data to understand how you use Squire, to test
            features and tools, ensure Squire is working properly, and protect it from bad actors.
            We use personal data to improve Squire. For example: to troubleshoot and protect against errors;
            perform data analysis and testing; conduct research and surveys; develop new products or
            tools; and refine our algorithms and machine learning applications.
            We use your email address to send you information about Squire or our Partners. You can opt-out
            from receiving messages at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” in any email you receive.
            We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send
            promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you. These communications are
            aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including
            information about new features, survey requests, events and other information we think may be
            of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and
            contests.
            We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, more secure, integrated
            and useful to you. To that end, we use collective learnings about how people use our Services
            and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity
            patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services.
            We use personal data to promote the safety and security of Squire, our users, and other parties.
            For example, to protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct
            audits, and enforce our terms and other policies.
            When is personal data shared?
            We never sell personal data. We only share it with consent or when required or permitted by
            law.
            Here are the circumstances under which your personal data may be shared:
            When you consent, agree or direct us to share it.
            The Squire Service includes links and interactions with third parties that aren’t controlled by Squire.
            We partner with these organizations because they provide benefits that we think makes the Squire
            experience more beneficial to you. We do not share personal data with partners unless you
            direct us to do so and we include a link to the partner’s privacy policy in the Services so you will
            know how your data will be used by that partner.
            Please note that once data is shared with a third party, it is covered by any policies that apply to
            that third party and you will have to contact them directly to access or delete your personal data.
            To provide the Squire Services. We transfer data to service providers and other partners who
            process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and other
            confidentiality and security measures enforced by legal contract. This processing can include
            services such as customer support, cloud storage, marketing, data analysis, research, and
            surveys.
            We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service operated by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google
            Analytics uses cookies (text files) stored on your computer to allow for analysis of your visits to
            websites and interactions with them in order to personalize your experience and improve the
            Services. You may prevent data from being used by Google Analytics by downloading and
            installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
            To comply with the Law. We may disclose the information we collect in order to comply with the
            law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court
            order or a subpoena.
            Please note: Our policy is to notify you of legal process seeking access to your information,
            such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, unless we are prohibited by law from
            doing so. In cases where a court order specifies a non-disclosure period, we provide delayed
            notice after the expiration of the non-disclosure period. Exceptions to our notice policy include
            exigent or counterproductive circumstances, for example, when there is an emergency involving
            a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person.
            To Protect Us and Others. We may disclose the information we collect where we believe it is
            necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
            situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use
            or this Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which Squire is involved.
            Business Transfers. If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of
            our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or
            reorganization, we will give affected users notice before transferring any personal data to a new
            entity.
            How do you keep data safe?
            We use a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to keep user data
            secure. Data is always transmitted via secure channels. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
            using the industry best practice encryption standards (e.g. S/MIME, X.509 certificates, TLS) to
            safeguard your information. Data is protected as it travels over the internet during read and write
            operations using HTTPS. We use HIPAA-compliant products and services for health data
            storage and processing. In addition to using state-of-the-art security systems, we also have
            strict internal access-control policies to prevent privacy violations.
